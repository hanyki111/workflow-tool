# Introduction to AI Workflow Engine

Welcome to the AI Workflow Engine tutorial!

## What is Workflow-Tool?

The AI Workflow Engine is a structured workflow management system designed for AI-assisted development. It helps maintain discipline and consistency throughout the development process.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Stages
The workflow is divided into stages:
- **Milestone Stages (M0-M4)**: High-level project phases
- **Phase Stages (P1-P7)**: Detailed implementation steps

### 2. Checklists
Each stage has a checklist of items that must be completed before moving to the next stage.

### 3. Transitions
Moving between stages requires completing all checklist items and meeting any additional conditions.

## Why Use This Tool?

1. **Process Discipline**: Ensures critical steps aren't skipped
2. **Context Awareness**: AI assistants can read the workflow state
3. **Documentation**: Every transition is logged
4. **Quality Control**: Built-in review stages

## Quick Start

```bash
# Check current status
flow status

# Mark items as done
flow check 1 2 3

# Move to next stage
flow next
```
